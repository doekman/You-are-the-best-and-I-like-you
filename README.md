# tezd
Test repo for renaming.

This repository has been renamed
from [tezd](https://github.com/doekman/tezd)
  to [test](https://github.com/doekman/test)
  to [tesd](https://github.com/doekman/tesd)
  to [You-are-so-lame](https://github.com/doekman/You-are-so-lame)
  to [You-are-the-best-and-I-like-you](https://github.com/doekman/You-are-the-best-and-I-like-you).

Apparently GitHub keeps a list of old repository names, and redirects to the newest one.
